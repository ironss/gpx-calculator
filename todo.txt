* Create an overlay for a map.

* Pass a 'scale' parameter, and calculate the time and distance intervals from that, 
  rather than specifying time and distance explicitly. It might need map scale and
  viewing distance.

* How do we specify data to be stored with each calculated point? Or do we just store 
  everythings for each point (lat, lon, time, track time, track distance, speed, 
  average speed, distance and bearing to next point, etc).




1. Download data from Holux 1000C and save in separate GPX files -- done

2. Download current track data from Garmin 72H -- done

3. Download tracks from Android phone -- MX Mariner

4. Download tracks from Android phone -- Orux Maps

5. Download tracks from Android phone -- SensorRecord

6. Ensure that track has a sensible name, probably the same
   as the file name.
   
7. After downloading, check that file does not already exist with identical content.

8. Describe how to set up udev for the Garmin device -- done

9. Decide how to archive tracks:
   * where on PC
   * where to back up
   * file name
   * track name
   * details of the recording device
   * description of track

10. Garmin file name must include time of first trackpoint.
    But it has multiple track segments which should be separate tracks.
    It has multiple track -- all of the save tracks.
    Need to call a separate program to sort out these issues
    
11. After downloading and renaming tracks, add them to a GIT repository and 
    commit them. Push to remote server for backup.


A track should be identified as
* manufacturer
* model
* serial number, MAC address or other unique identifier
* time of first trackpoint



In the case of a track generated by a program, it should be
identified as
* program
* device name (eg samsung_s3, vf845, huawei_u8510)
* serial number, MAC address, volume ID or other unique identifier
* time of first trackpoint

1. Download data from device into a temporary location
2. Separate track segments into their own tracks
3. Separate points with 60 minute difference into their own tracks
4. Ensure that track names are correct
5. Work out the file names
6. Check that the file does not exist in the archive location
7. If it does, then choose a new name ... how?
8. If not, move it to the archive location
