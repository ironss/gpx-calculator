Todo
====

* Pass a 'scale' parameter, and calculate the time and distance intervals from that, 
  rather than specifying time and distance explicitly. It might need map scale and
  viewing distance.

* How do we specify data to be stored with each calculated point? Or do we just store 
  everythings for each point (lat, lon, time, track time, track distance, speed, 
  average speed, distance and bearing to next point, etc)
