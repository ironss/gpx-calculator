GPX calculations
################

Purpose
=======
Given a GPS track, calculate points at regular intervals along the track.
The points can be calculated:

* with a fixed distance between them

* with a fixed time interval between them


Input
=====
* A GPX file containing one or more GPS tracks (GPX <trk> tag)

* A parameter specifying the distance between points

* A parameter specifying the time between points


Output
======
Two GPX files containing

* waypoints calculated at regular time intervals

* waypoints calculated at regular distance intervals


Each calculated waypoint has the following data calculated from
the track data:

* latitude and longitude

* time in UTC
 
* time in seconds from the start of the track

* distance from the start of the track

* speed

 1. Tests for distance_between() -- DONE

 2. Tests for bearing()          -- DONE

 3. Tests for destination()      -- DONE

 4. Tests for date parser        -- DONE

 5. Tests for gpx calculations

 6. Use luaunit test framework   -- DONE

 7. luaunit: hide stacktrace     -- DONE

 8. Generate time waypoints      -- DONE

 9. Generate distance waypoints  -- DONE

10. Generate absolute-time waypoints -- DONE

11. Verify that initial segment works correctly -- DONE

12. Test for track calculations.

13. Can we pass a 'scale' parameter, and calculate the distance and time intervals from that?

14. How do we specify data to be stored with each point?

15. Use pure lua XML parser and creator -- DONE
