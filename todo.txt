* Tests for calculations of equal time intervals

* Can we pass a 'scale' parameter, and calculate the distance and time intervals from that?

* How do we specify data to be stored with each calculated point? Or do we just store 
  everythings for each point (lat, lon, time, track time, track distance, speed, 
  average speed, distance and bearing to next point, etc)

* Add meta-tables to xml.lua          -- in progress

* Add escape encoding/decoding to xml.lua 

* Tests for XML find

* Use LuaExpat LOM rather than homebrew, even though it is not pure lua,
  because it is available in Ubuntu repositories.
